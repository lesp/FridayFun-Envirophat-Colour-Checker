# Envirophat Colour Checker

This project came about via a discussion with Izzy at Picademy Manchester (October 3 2017).

Izzy works at Leeds Museum and has access to various wallpapers and fabrics that are too delicate for the public to touch, but she wanted the public to interact with the items.
Izzy used the Pi camera to approximate the colour of a garment worn by the visitor, and they select a matching item from the collection.
I spoke to Izzy and mentioned that the Envirophat from Pimoroni could do the same job, with less code, and well here is a proof of concept.

[Blog post will be at](http://bigl.es) as part of my Friday Fun posts.

Thanks!
